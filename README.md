This website serves as a webstore for both my Minecraft related services as well as my software development services. It's a part of my Public Business website that is composed of this site, a landing page, another single page website for my content creation, as well as a another unlisted page.

It's a simple HTML & CSS website using Bootstrap, and was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development. It's made up of several pages/sections which are listed in the Site-Map bellow.

##### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, all you have to do is download it and open the HTML files with your prefered browser. To run the PHP code you will likely need to run it on a Linux machine, or install PHP on windows (somehow).

Feel free to report bugs at the bug page here on GitHub and I'll address them!
